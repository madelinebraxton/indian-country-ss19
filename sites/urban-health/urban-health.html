     <p>Many studies show that Native peoples in the United States live their lives in poorer health compared to other demographics (Burhansstipanov 2000, Gracey & King 2009, Phillips 2016). While people may recognize the disparity between these various peoples, the reason behind its existence is full of stigma. Often the blame is placed on Native people based on harmful stereotypes and a lack of historic understanding, when in actuality the root of the issue stems from the history of colonialism. These systemic issues are still perpetuated by the United States government to this day, and health/access to health care is an area of great concern. Thus emerged organizations like the Native American Lifelines (NAL), that help Native peoples living in the Boston and Baltimore area aim to improve their quality of life, educate them on healthy lifestyle practices and provide a community for them to get back in touch with their roots.</p>

         <h3>History of Urbanization</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>Contrary to most modern day perceptions of Native people, most do not live on reservations. In actuality, 78 percent of Native peoples live in an urban setting (<a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/cph-series/cph-t/cph-t-6.html">US Census 2010</a>, Burt 1986:85). This urban movement has, historically, been a manipulative assimilation and integration into US society (Burt: 1986:86). People move to cities for a variety of different reasons. In this case, the history of why Native peoples are living such urban lives is once again rooted in European settlement. They were originally pushed out of their lands and forced to live in undesirable locations in the US for the greed of resources and a superiority complex. Burhansstipanov describes this progression in five stages: removal, reservation, reorganization, termination, and self-determination, where the “‘Reorganization’ and ‘Termination’ stages have had a significant impact on urban Indian health” (1208). Native peoples have had their land stolen, reallocated, and further still, fractionized.</p>

                          </figure>

                 <p>In the mid 20th century, everyone, not just Native peoples, began flocking to cities because of the plethora of job availability, or so that is how the US government would interpret the situation. Sure, many people saw it as their best chance to move forward in life. Other people recognize this a the Termination Period. Which is partly described this way because “some noted that relocation amounted to individual termination since Native Americans no longer qualifed [sic] for federal services once off their reservations.“ (Burt 1986:88). There was an insidious reasoning behind the encouragement of Native peoples movement, in that the US government wanted their land and to weaken their sovereignty. Times like the Cold War brought with it a terror that any potentially competing governmental allegiance should be systematically diminished and disbanded through the dispersal of their people (Burt 1986: 86). This fear helped influence policy makers to increase Native dependency on the US government by reducing the funding to sovereignty building programs and policies. These policies were created in the 1930’s New Deal, which is also characterized by the “Reorganization” period, where cultural repression lessoned (Burt 1986:86, Burhansstipanov 2000:1208).</p>

                 <p>The nationalistic incorporation of Native peoples into more mainstream society not only reduced their sovereignty, but also their health. During this relocation effort of reservation to urban life, Native peoples were specifically placed away from each other, with the idea that the assimilation process would be made easier if they did not have a community to reinforce their cultural ideals (Burhansstipanov 2000:1209). Cutting people off from their community results in a massive reduction in a supportive social group, which is incredibly important for a person’s emotional well-being. The access to the available resources, such as distance to healthcare facilities, markets, schools, and jobs in urban areas perpetuates more movement of Natives to leave the reservations, whether they really wanted to or not. Once urbanized, Native people are exposed to the sociocultural eating habits of the locals and in particular, socioeconomic status. Healthier foods are more expensive, wherever you live in the US, unless you grow it yourself. With the rise of cost efficient, high calorie processed foods, Native people in urban areas with a low income have little choice but to each these cheaper options. This is a large change from many traditional Native food lifestyles which generally focus on the cultivation of homegrown foods and harvesting of local flora and fauna.</p>

                    <figcaption>Image 3: The Three Sisters: Corn, Squash, and Beans</figcaption>
                  </figure>

            <p>Of course, Native peoples health did not always exist in this state. Before colonization Native people in the U.S.  had a very healthy diet because they ate fairly balanced foods that were not processed, and they took care of the land. They had fish, the “Three Sisters”: corn, beans, and squash, and healthy soil. While the agricultural methods that European colonization brought with provide an easy solution to mass food production, it strips the nutritional content from everyone’s diet, depletes the soil, and leaves little room for other subsistence activities such as hunting (Gracey & King 2009:66).</p>

              <p>Today, we have seen the toll of the 2019 US government shutdown. It exposes Native healthcare to the destructive tendencies of the dependent relationship that the US has placed on them. The Native American Lifelines office in the Baltimore and Boston area explains on the front page of their website under “Upcoming Events: Our agency is currently effected [sic] by the federal government shutdown. To check available services in your area, please contact your local NAL office” (Urban Indian Health Services: Native American Lifelines 2014). NAL works on a cost-reimbursement system with the Indian Health Service (IHS). Before the shutdown, they were still owed <em>two months</em> worth of vouchers from the (IHS) (Martin 2019). Like hundreds of other organizations, once the shutdown was in effect, they received no more payments, and they had to suspend medical and mental services (Martin 2019).</p>

              <p>As I am writing this, it is April, and the government shutdown is still portraying lasting negative effects on tribal healthcare that depends on federal money. Executive Director of NAL, Kerry Hawk-Lessard explains that the US federal government is not honoring the legal agreements they made with tribal treaties. She states that “this relationship should not be impacted by the federal government’s inability to come to a resolution with regard to appropriations” (Lessard 2019). She further compares Native healthcare with the Veterans Administration, which provides healthcare to those who served. The Veterans Administration is unaffected by the shutdown. Native health should be just as important.</p>

         <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
            <p>One of the main problems with their ability to help others is visibility. As discussed earlier, Native peoples were purposefully pushed under the radar. A study conducted by Phillips (2009) “urban AI/ANs [American Indian/Alaska Natives] are significantly more likely to report having not seen or talked with a health professional in the past year or more compared with NHWs [non-Hispanic whites].” Lessard also explains that “on the east coast, non-Natives don't tend to think of us even being here, and not only is that a problem in terms of funding, but it is very demoralizing to the Native people living here or being from eastern tribes, and thus deepens the historical trauma.” While there are clearly programs that exist, not everyone is aware of them. While Native peoples are doing an incredible job at pushing back, holding their ground, and building up their sovereignty and self-determined lives, the US government, policy makers, and the general public lack an awareness to these issues and are not holding themselves responsible for this shortcoming.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Lessard explained to me that it is important to be mindful in trying to help situations like this. As she described, there is a difference between “saving” and “serving”. While non-Native people may want to help, they should be aware of “white saviorism,” which promotes a marginalizing ideology. When Lessard became the executive director of NAL, she pushed for a more community centered approach towards running the program. She is a Shawnee Native, and many of her other staff members are Native, which allows them to communicate and connect with the Native community on a deeper level than a non-Native person could. She also pointed out that policies created to tear Native peoples down never fully succeeded. She still has family who left the boarding schools they were sent to and returned to the reservations, and the US government never intended for that to happen. Through their work, NAL has helped countless Native people in Boston, and organizations like them around the country continue to promote good health for Native people and promote a positive community in urban centers.</p>
